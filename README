== Welcome to MyBlog On Rails

This is a simple web application developed using Ruby on Rails.
It is intended to showcase the functionality of Rails while giving users a 
concrete example which they can examine.

This database was created using the db:create and db:rake tools with:
posts title:string body:text
users username:string password:string email:string

This is obviously a very basic implementation, with some critical holes, 
but should be enough for the user to explore on their own.
